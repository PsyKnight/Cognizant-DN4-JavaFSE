Exercise 1: Mocking and Stubbing

Scenario:

You need to test a service that depends on an external API. Use Mockito to mock the
external API and stub its methods.

Steps:

1. Create a mock object for the external API.
2. Stub the methods to return predefined values.
3. Write a test case that uses the mock object.
