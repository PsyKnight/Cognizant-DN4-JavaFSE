Objectives

•	Define SPA and its benefits

Ans: 
- An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as Fetch when different content is to be shown.

- This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

Benefits

- Improved Speed and Responsiveness

- Smoother User Experience

- Resource Efficiency

- Mobile Friendliness and Cross-Platform Consistency

- Development Convenience

- Easier Feature-Rich Interactions

- Better Caching

•	Define React and identify its working

Ans:

- Free and open-source JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). 
- Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a broad community, React enables developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes without reloading the page

1. Component Architecture

- Functional Components are simple functions that receive data (props) and return what should be displayed (JSX).

- Class Components (less common today) are ES6 classes with additional features like local state and lifecycle methods.

- Components are self-contained, reusable, and can be combined to build complex interfaces.

2. Virtual DOM

- Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When a component’s state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one using a process called reconciliation or diffing.

- Only the parts of the DOM that have actually changed are updated, making rendering very efficient.

3. Unidirectional Data Flow

- One-way data binding means data flows from parent to child components via props. This structure makes applications predictable and easier to debug.

4. Declarative Rendering

- Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, developers declare how the UI should look for each possible state. React takes care of updating the view whenever the data changes.



•	Identify the differences between SPA and MPA

| Aspect                  | SPA (Single Page Application)                                           | MPA (Multi Page Application)                                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**        | Loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content using JavaScript | Navigates through multiple separate HTML pages; each is loaded from server |
| **Navigation**          | No full page reloads; updates sections dynamically                      | Full page reload for every new page or section                           |
| **Speed**               | Faster interactions after initial load; initial load may be heavier      | Slower interactions; each navigation triggers a new page load            |
| **User Experience**     | Smooth, app-like, seamless transitions and interactivity                 | Traditional web navigation with visible page loads and reloads           |
| **SEO**                 | More challenging; needs extra configuration for indexing                 | More SEO-friendly; each page can be indexed and optimized separately     |
| **Development Complexity** | Uses JS frameworks; modular, reusable components                   | Easier for simple sites; complex ones need more backend/frontend integration |
| **Security**            | More vulnerable to client-side attacks; needs careful handling           | Typically more secure; logic handled on server                           |
| **Scalability**         | Can be harder to scale very large apps                                   | Naturally suited for large, content-rich sites                           |
| **Offline Capabilities**| Enhanced with service workers                                            | Limited; each page load needs server access                              |
| **Back/Forward Navigation** | Needs extra code for deep linking and browser navigation          | Native browser navigation works as expected                              |
| **Best Use Cases**      | Dashboards, social networks, SaaS products, apps needing interactivity   | E-commerce, news sites, blogs, large portals                             |


•	Explain Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application

| Pros                                   | Cons                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Fast, app-like user experience          | Harder to optimize for SEO                     |
| Seamless, dynamic navigation            | Heavier initial load time                      |
| Efficient data fetching                 | More client-side security concerns             |
| Reusable code for web & mobile          | Requires extra work for navigation/history     |
| Rich, interactive features              | JS dependency; may not work with JS disabled   |
| Simplifies front-end/back-end separation| More complex analytics/tracking needs          |

•	Explain about React

Ans:

- free, open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs), particularly for web and native applications. Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a large developer community, React allows developers to build dynamic, interactive, and scalable interfaces efficiently

•	Define virtual DOM

Ans:

- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept used in JavaScript frameworks like React to improve efficiency in updating user interfaces. It is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM—essentially a copy of the current UI preserved as JavaScript objects, rather than directly tied to the rendered page

•	Explain Features of React

Ans: 

- Component-Based Architecture
- Declarative UI
- Virtual DOM
- JSX (JavaScript XML)
- Unidirectional Data Flow
- State Management
- Lifecycle Methods (Hooks)
- React Native Support
- Extensive Ecosystem
